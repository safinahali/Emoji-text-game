Know-your-emoji is a text based endless runner game. The player enters the names of the emoji obstacles. If these tags are correct, when the names are returned, the player jumps. If the tags are incorrect, the player cannot jump. Score adds up with successful jumps. If the player hits the obstacle, he/she dies. 

This is a Javascript based game. I used Phaser to make the game: http://phaser.io/docs

Older versions of the game are included. I started by trying to create a game about social privilege. Version 1 had icons depicting life obstacles, and the player tries to describe them. Version 2 is an improved version of the Version 1. Version 3 is a narrative based game, where the player picks works from a story to describe historical pictures. Due to usability problem, and complexity by trying to depict too many things, I narrowed down the scope to build a text based emoji guessing game.
